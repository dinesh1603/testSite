<P CLASS="noindent"><B><FONT SIZE="7" COLOR="#FF0000">L</FONT>OVE AND COMPASSION</B> are the two rails on which the entire Christhood has come into this world! Yes, it is true! Without Christ, there is no love and compassion among humankind.</P>

<P>When Jesus was born in the small Jewish hamlet - Bethlehem, some two thousand years ago, the Angel of the <B>L<SMALL>ORD</SMALL></B> appeared to the negligible sect of shepherds who were keeping watch over their flock by night and said to them -<BR><CENTER><TABLE BGCOLOR="#FFEBCD" BORDER="0" CELLPADDING="7" WIDTH="65%"><TR><TD><P CLASS="NOINDENT"><FONT COLOR="#9400D3"> <I><B>"Do not be afraid. I bring you <U>the good news of great joy</U> that will be for all the people. Today in the town of David a Saviour has been born to you; he is Christ, the </I><B>L<SMALL>ORD</SMALL></B>..."</B> <SMALL>(Luke 2:10 & 11).</SMALL></P></FONT></TD></TR></TABLE></CENTER></P>

<P>So, along with His birth itself Jesus brings <B><I><FONT COLOR="red">'good news of <BIG><U>great joy'</U></BIG></FONT></I></B>&nbsp;&nbsp;to all the people on the face of the earth without any discretion of any cast or creed! Hallelujah!</P>

<P>The great joy of true love and compassion has descended from Heaven! It's all for us and for us alone! What a good news indeed!</P>

<P>While Jesus began His ministry, He declared clearly, from the prophetical word of the Scripture, the very purpose to which He came into this world:<BR><CENTER><TABLE BGCOLOR="#Fedcba" BORDER="0" CELLPADDING="7" WIDTH="65%"><TR><TD><P CLASS="NOINDENT"><FONT COLOR="#8B0000"><I><B>"... because the <B>L<SMALL>ORD</SMALL></B> has anointed me to preach good news to the poor.<BR>He has sent me to bind up the broken-hearted,<BR>- to proclaim freedom for the captives and release from darkness for the prisoners,<BR>- to proclaim the year of the <B>L<SMALL>ORD</SMALL></B>'s favour and the day of vengeance of our God,<BR>- to comfort all who mourn,<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; and provide for those who grieve in Zion - to bestow on them<UL STYLE TYPE="square">
<LI>- a crown of beauty instead of ashes,
<LI>- the oil of gladness instead of mourning, and
<LI>- a garment of praise instead of a spirit of despair.</I>..."</B><SMALL>(Isaiah 61:1-3).</SMALL></UL></P></FONT></TD></TR></TABLE></CENTER></P>

<P>Jesus practised this very message in His whole earthly life of thirty-three and a half years.</P>

<P>Among the thirty-three miracles performed by Jesus Christ that are recorded in the Bible, twenty-four are related to physical healing; three are to the raising the people from the dead and two times He fed the people numbering 5,000 and 4,000 respectively. In all these circumstances He ministered the needy people with full of love and compassion! The Bible says Jesus was <B><I><FONT COLOR="red">'healing all manner of sickness and all manner of disease among the people.'</FONT></I></B><SMALL>(Matthew 4:23).</SMALL></P>

<P>He never showed any partiality of caste and creed. Everyone who came to Him got his or her wants satisfactorily fulfilled. Even when lepers came to Him, He <B><I><FONT COLOR="red">'put forth His hand and touched'</FONT></I></B> them without any hesitation or reservation and made them clean.<SMALL>(Matthew 8:2&3).</SMALL></P>

<P>When Jesus saw a large crowd which came to listen to Him in the desert, He was moved with compassion and to the dismay of His disciples He said to them:<BR><CENTER><TABLE BGCOLOR="#F0F8FF" BORDER="0" CELLPADDING="7" WIDTH="60%"><TR><TD><P CLASS="NOINDENT"><FONT COLOR="#00008B"><I><B>"I have compassion for these people; they have already been with me for three days and have nothing to eat. I do not want to send them away hungry, or they may collapse on the way" </B><SMALL>(Matthew 15:32).</SMALL></P></FONT></TD></TR></TABLE></CENTER></P>

<P>Such is the heart of the Christ!</P>

<P>On another occasion, when Jesus saw the crying mother for her dead son, His heart went out to her and He raised that young man <SMALL>(Luke 7:11-15).</SMALL> But, He went one step further when He saw the weeping sister of one Lazarus. Jesus groaned in His spirit and released Lazarus from his death bondage <SMALL>(John 11:33-44).</SMALL></P>

<P>On seeing Jesus' loving kindness, <B><I><FONT COLOR="brown">'a woman who had been subject to bleeding for twelve long years'</FONT></I></B> got healed by merely touching the edge of His cloak <SMALL>(Matthew 9:20-22).</SMALL> In such an egregious way His lovingness and compassion have been overflowing even in His garments! But, for an army officer, one word from the mouth of Jesus was enough to get healing for his sickly servant! <SMALL>(Matthew 8:5-13).</SMALL> Hallelujah!</P>

<P>Even His enemies were not kept away from Jesus' love and compassion! On the night of His betrayal, when one of His disciples struck the servant of the high priest and cut off his right ear, Jesus rebuked His man and healed that bleeding servant instantly <SMALL>(Luke 22:50-51).</SMALL> That was Jesus!</P>

<P>Even in Calvary, being crucified on the cross, Jesus had the love for His tormentors! He prayed, <B><I><FONT COLOR="brown">'Father, forgive them, for they do not know what they are doing'</FONT></I></B> <SMALL>(Luke 23:34).</SMALL></P>

<P CLASS="noindent"><B><FONT SIZE="7" COLOR="#FF0000">T</FONT>HERE IS ONE</B> beautiful, but, meaningful picture. It was drawn by the artist, Subarto Sen. This picture becomes meaningful by the words written on it.</P>

<P>There is a very rough wooden cross on the background of a deep blue sky. A white veil is drooping on its horizontal beam. At the top of the vertical beam, a crown of thorns is hanging. this is the picture.</P>

<P>In the bottom portion of the picture, above the name of the artist, these words are written:<BR><CENTER><TABLE BGCOLOR="556B2F" BORDER="0" CELLPADDING="7"><TR><TD><P CLASS="NOINDENT"><FONT SIZE="5" COLOR="white"><CENTER><I><B><BIG>I asked Jesus<BR>"How much do you love me?"<BR>"This Much"<BR>He answered,<BR>Then He stretched out<BR>His arms and died.</BIG></B></I</CENTER></FONT></P></TD></TR></TABLE></CENTER></P>

<P>The tell-tale meaning expressed the very essence of His love and compassion explicitly!</P>

<P>The love of Jesus has no boundary. It is not for one nation or a particular group of people. His love and compassion are for all of us; for, Jesus is for all of us. He came to this world for all of us; He died on the cross for all of us and He resurrected from death for all of us!</P>

<P>On the cross <B><I><FONT COLOR="#00008B">'... He hath borne our griefs, and carried our sorrows..'</FONT></I></B> <SMALL>(Isaiah 53:4).</SMALL> Also from His cross, <B><I><FONT COLOR="#00008B">'Christ hath redeemed us from the curse of the law, being made a curse for us.'</FONT></I></B> <SMALL>(Galatians 3:13).</SMALL></P>

<P><B><I><FONT COLOR="#00008B">'He was wounded for transgressions, He was bruised for our iniquities: the chastisement of our peace was upon Him, and with His stripes we are healed.'</FONT></I></B> <SMALL>(Isaiah 53:5).</SMALL></P>

<P>Not only that, Jesus is the Lamb of God, who take away the sin of the world. <SMALL>(John 1:29).</SMALL></P>

<P><B><I><FONT SIZE="4" COLOR="#00008B">'By this we know love, because He laid down His life for us.'</FONT></I></B> <SMALL>(1 John 3:16).</SMALL> Hallelujah!</P>

<P CLASS="NOINDENT"><CENTER><TABLE BGCOLOR="#ADFF2F" BORDER="0" CELLPADDING="7" WIDTH="60%"><TR VALIGN="top"><TD VALIGN="top"><FONT SIZE="5" COLOR="#A52A2A"><CENTER><I><B><BIG>In this way, from cradle to cross, Jesus Christ showed His love and compassion towards the mankind abundantly! </BIG></B></I></CENTER> </FONT></TD></TR></TABLE></CENTER></P>

<P>He was not dead once for all on the cross. He has resurrected. A hard fact to believe by the present-day expert humankind. But He is still living ... ... living among us with all His abounding love and compassion. He is easily available to everybody even today for those who are seeking Him sincerely! </P>

<P>This <B><I><FONT COLOR="#00008B">'Jesus Christ is the same yesterday and today and forever.'</FONT></I></B> <SMALL>(Hebrews 13:8).</SMALL> Anybody can find Him and have His everlasting blessings only if they seek Him <B><I><FONT COLOR="#00008B">'with all thy heart and with all thy soul.'</FONT></I></B> <SMALL>(Deuteronomy 4:29).</SMALL></P>

<P>Moreover,<B><I><FONT COLOR="#00008B">'neither is there salvation in any other: for there is no other name under heaven given among men, whereby we must be saved.'</FONT></I></B> <SMALL>(Acts 4:12).</SMALL></P>

<P>Since <CENTER><TABLE BGCOLOR="#F0F8FF" BORDER="0" CELLPADDING="7" WIDTH="60%"><TR><TD><P CLASS="NOINDENT"><FONT SIZE="5" COLOR="#00008B"><CENTER><I><B><BIG><B><I>'Christ Jesus came into the world to save sinners.' <SMALL>(1 Timothy 1:15),</SMALL> 'everyone who calls on the name of the <B>L<SMALL>ORD</SMALL></B> will be saved ... For there is no difference between Jew and Gentile - the same <B>L<SMALL>ORD</SMALL></B> is <B>L<SMALL>ORD</SMALL></B> of all and richly blesses all who call on Him.'</I></B><SMALL>(Romans 10:12&13).</SMALL></BIG></B></I></CENTER> </FONT></P></TD></TR></TABLE></CENTER></P>

<P>This very same Jesus Christ will come soon again with all His Heavenly Glory to judge this world according to each one's word and deed. Also while He comes a such in His father's Glory with His angels, He will reward each person according to what he/she has done.</P>

<P>Therefore, awake to the righteousness of love and compassion, and stop wallowing into the deep mire of sin by seeking Jesus Christ diligently as your <BIG><B>L<SMALL>ORD</SMALL></B></BIG> and <BIG><B>Saviour!</B></BIG></P>

<P>May the <BIG><B>L<SMALL>ORD</SMALL></B></BIG> Jesus Christ open your eyes and mind to see and understand His everlasting glory upon this earth itself! <BR><CENTER><FONT SIZE="+2" COLOR="#9400D3"><BIG><B>Amen! Amen!</B></BIG></FONT></CENTER></P>
