Without love, nothing is acceptable to God. Christ showed us that nothing is more beautiful than this when He gave His own Flesh for our flesh and His Soul for our souls.</P>

<P>'We must hasten with all earnestness and readiness of mind, to perfect every good work, labouring with cheerfulness; for even the Creator and <B>L<SMALL>ORD</SMALL></B> of all things rejoices in His own works'</P>

<P>- This was the voice of one Jewish convert, considered one of the disciples of Peter and Paul, the Apostles. His name was Clement. Tradition has it that he was the same Clement who was mentioned in Philippians 4:3 as <I><B>'fellow labourer'</B></I>.</P>

<P CLASS="noindent"><B><FONT FACE="EngrvrsOldEng Bd BT" SIZE="36.0pt" COLOR="#CC00CC">I</FONT>N THE YEAR</B> 96 AD, as per the history, Clement wrote a letter to the Corinthians. Because in the Corinthian Church, a violent faction once again erupted vehemently and ruined the Church meticulously. Earlier, Paul also in Chapter 3 of his first Epistle to this Church, severely warned such groups in his carefully chosen words.</P>

<P>Even so, these warring groups did not desist themselves from their carnality by envying divisions. So only it was necessary for clement, being a <I><B>'fellow labourer'</B></I> of Paul, to make an appeal to their discipline within the Church and to overcome the jealousy which had been the cause for their internal strife.</P>

<P>But in 100 AD, Clement was exiled to Crimea, by the persecuting emperor, Trajan. In his exile, Clement became the consolation for some 2,000 fellow Christian prisoners. During that time, he once said: 'God has granted me a grace, of which, I was not worthy, by sending me amongst you, to share your crown.' Such was his passion for His Church and also for suffering for His sake.</P>

<P>He never wanted to be a great man or a leader or a master in his life; but, his entire nature was: <FONT Serif" SIZE="+1" COLOR="#800000"><B><I><U>LET HIM ALONE...!</U></I></B></FONT></P>

<P>What about you and me?</P>

<P>Do the others see our <B>L<SMALL>ORD</SMALL></B>, the Christ in us or do they see only our personality in ourselves?</P>

<P CLASS="noindent"><B><FONT FACE="EngrvrsOldEng Bd BT" SIZE="36.0pt" COLOR="#CC00CC">P</FONT>AUL SAYS IN</B> Galatians 3:20 - <FONT COLOR="#FF0000"><I><B>"I am crucified with Christ: nevertheless, I live; yet, not I, but Christ liveth in me ..."</B></I></FONT></P>

<P>Can we boldly say like this?</P>

<P> Nowadays, most people want to boast about themselves as if they know everything under the Sun. If they have a thorough knowledge of the Bible, that is enough! They always put themselves above all things and have developed an unquenchable craving to be treated in like manner by others because they have a thorough knowledge of the Bible! Wretched madness!</P>

<P> Of course, their beginning may be so humble and lowly. When our <B>L<SMALL>ORD</SMALL></B> begins to bless others through them in every way, their thinking, their attitudes and their everything hardens gradually and their whole being slowly moves away... away... and away from their real Master and Saviour.</P>

<P>In fact <FONT COLOR="#FF0000"><I><B>"they fear the <B>L<SMALL>ORD</SMALL></B>",</B></I></FONT> but <FONT COLOR="#FF0000"><I><B>"serve their own gods"</B></I></FONT>. <SMALL>[2 Kings 17:33]</SMALL></P>

<P>Without realising this dangerous misfortune, they are so happy and gay while seeing the blessings of the <B>L<SMALL>ORD</SMALL></B> bestowed upon their surrounding people through them. The <B>L<SMALL>ORD</SMALL></B>'s doing is due to His abounding Love and Concern for those lost sheep. But they misunderstand His Grace for them.</P>

<P> At this point, they cannot tolerate any remarks or criticism of their words and actions. If anyone dares to say something against them or speak about them, they ostracise that person and deliberately place obstacles in their spiritual and physical path. Because they firmly believe that this person would be very much a danger to their fame and power realm.</P>

<P> In a way, such a stumbling block or an occasion which they put against their fellow people's life is very much necessary for those pitiable people; since, their faith <FONT COLOR="#FF0000"><I><B>"being much more precious than of gold that perisheth, is to be tried with fire and be found unto praise and honour and glory at the appearing of Jesus Christ."</B></I></FONT> <SMALL>[2 Peter 1:7]</SMALL></P>

<P>Moreover, <FONT COLOR="#FF0000"><I><B>"we know that all things work together for good to them that love God, to them who are the called according to His purpose."</B></I></FONT> <SMALL>[Romans 8:28]</SMALL></P>

<P>But the stern warning to which the eyes of these hypocritic boasters are darkened is: <FONT COLOR="#FF0000"><I><B>"Woe unto him, through whom they</B></I></FONT> (the obstacles/offences) <FONT COLOR="#FF0000"><I><B>come!"</B></I></FONT> <SMALL>[Luke 17:1]</SMALL></P>

<P>These are all show their itching <B><I>'self-centredness'</I></B>. To keep up this egotism, they are ready to go to any length or part with any price at their mite.</P>

<P>In this way they unknowingly begin to build their own kingdoms instead of His Kingdom and throw away their earlier commitment and devotion to their god and Liberator to the eastern wind!</P>

<P>Remember...</P>

<P>Who they are?</P>

<P CLASS="margin">- the one who gains command of the Bible from left to right and from right to left. Only for this knowledge they are admired and adored by scores of people and this made them heroes among the lay people from length and breadth of the countries!</P>

<P>But finally these heroes will lose their souls along with their fans in eternity!</P>

<P>Oh! no doubt they have <FONT COLOR="#FF0000"><I><B>"begun in the Spirit"</B></I></FONT>, but now they make <FONT COLOR="#FF0000"><I><B>"perfect by the flesh..."</B></I></FONT> <SMALL>[Galatians 3:3]</SMALL></P>

<P>What a pathetic situation...!</P>

<HR COLOR="#800000" WIDTH="40%">

<P CLASS="noindent"><B><FONT FACE="EngrvrsOldEng Bd BT" SIZE="36.0pt" COLOR="#CC00CC">T</FONT>HE REASON FOR</B> this grievous end has mainly taken root from '<FONT COLOR="#800000"><I><B>compromising mentality</B></I></FONT>', while the tap-root may be of '<FONT COLOR="#800000"><I><B>financial comfortability</B></I></FONT>'. Thus, the Enemy slowly wiped away their initial faith upon our <B>L<SMALL>ORD</SMALL></B> for the daily on-goings. Also, the Adversary brings financial constraints upon them in a phased manner along with a psychotic fear about their future as if they are the boss for their past, present and future. this is the time-old trick that the Devil plays upon every one of us. <FONT COLOR="#FF0000"><I><B>"For we are not ignorant of his devices."</B></I></FONT> <SMALL>[2 Corinthians 2:11]</SMALL></P>

<P>Then they begin to pray for more financial inflows to keep as reserves for their future course! What a contrast to the Biblical concept!</P>

<P>Our <B>L<SMALL>ORD</SMALL></B> teaches us to pray as: <FONT COLOR="#FF0000"><I><B>"Give us this day our daily bread"</B></I></FONT>. <SMALL>[Matthew 6:11]</SMALL>. He never leads us to ask: '<FONT COLOR="#800000"><I><B>Give us this day our lifetime share; so that we can keep it in our stores or banks for our future use.</B></I></FONT>' His only longing is, to have personal contact with us daily like the relationship between a father and his children. Such has been His uncompromising love towards us. Indeed, He is our Heavenly Father! Isn't He?</P>

<P>Hallelujah!</P>

<P>What a glorious heritage for those who have faith in Him!</P>

<P>Being our Father, He <FONT COLOR="#FF0000"><I><B>"knoweth what things we have need of, before we ask Him."</B></I></FONT> <SMALL>[Matthew 6:8]</SMALL>. Praise the <B>L<SMALL>ORD</SMALL></B>!</P>

<P>Proverbs 30:8&9 also guides us in praying as: <FONT COLOR="#FF0000"><I><B>"... Give me neither poverty nor riches; feed me with food convenient for me: Lest I be full, and deny thee and say, who is the <B>L<SMALL>ORD</SMALL></B>? or lest I be poor, and steal, and take the name of my God in vain."</B></I></FONT></P>

<P>However, the Deceiver promptly, sometimes abundantly honours one's wishes that are always contrary to the Biblical lines. When their financial needs are met more than sufficient, these individuals believe they are right in every aspect, as they see their prayers being answered. Consequently, they continue on their misguided path with joy. Not only that, they also lead so many young believers and followers in that very destructive direction blissfully!</P>

<P>With all probability, if they head some office, they run it exactly what they want it to be. That means, purely a one-man show or a private limited company... that's all! As a result, their office has a feeble management layer at the top. That is a cause for serious concern when the question of success comes to the fore. these boastful bureaucrats can never be able to produce even a single leader; but a crowded group of flatterers and second-fiddlers!</P>

<P>Not realising this vital truth, these people always find fault with those who question their very credibility because of it and drive them away from their vicinity with the help of their beloved flatterers! To serve this particular purpose they patronise a contingent of talebearers with all provincial prosperousness!</P>

<P>Let us taste a very few drops of promises from the Ocean of the Word of Life:</P>

<P><FONT COLOR="#FF0000"><I><B>"Thou whom I have taken from the ends of the earth, and called thee from the chief men thereof, and said unto thee, 'Thou art my servant; I have chosen thee, and not cast thee away.'</B></I></FONT></P>

<P><FONT COLOR="#FF0000"><I><B>"Fear thou not; for I am with thee: be not dismayed; for I am thy God: I will strengthen thee; yea, I will help thee; yea I will uphold thee with the right hand of my righteousness."</B></I></FONT> <SMALL>[Isaiah 41:9&10]</SMALL></P>

<P><FONT COLOR="#FF0000"><I><B>"I will go before thee, and make the crooked places straight..."</B></I></FONT> <SMALL>[Isaiah 45:2]</SMALL></P>

<P><FONT COLOR="#FF0000"><I><B>"Hearken unto me... which are borne by me from the belly, which are carried from the womb: And even to your old age I am He; and even to your hairs will I carry you: I have made, and I will bear, even I will carry, and will deliver you."</B></I></FONT> <SMALL>[Isaiah 46:3&4]</SMALL></P>

<P><FONT COLOR="#FF0000"><I><B>"Can a woman forget her sucking child, that she should not have compassion on the son of her womb? Yea, they may forget, yet will I not forget thee."</B></I></FONT></P>

<P><FONT COLOR="#FF0000"><I><B>"Behold, I have graven thee upon the palms of my hands; thy wall is continually before me."</B></I></FONT> <SMALL>[Isaiah 49:15&16]</SMALL></P>

<P>- What a marvellous God we have!</P>

<P>Really, He is <FONT COLOR="#FF0000"><I><B>"the same yesterday, and today, and forever."</B></I></FONT> <SMALL>[Hebrews 13:8]</SMALL></P>

<P> Like Him, His promises also are the same yesterday, and today and forever!</P>

<P>The result is, that they imbibe the quality of <FONT COLOR="#FF0000"><I><B>"compare themselves with some that commend themselves."</B></I></FONT> <SMALL>[2 Corinthians 10:12]</SMALL>.
