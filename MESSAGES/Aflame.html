<P CLASS="noindent"><B><FONT SIZE="7" COLOR="#FF0000">T</FONT>HAT WAS THURSDAY.</B> Within hours, He was to be betrayed by one of His own men; Another one was to deny Him three times before the dawn; Everyone around Him for the past three and a half years was going to desert Him. He was deeply troubled in His Spirit. The cruel crucifixion with all its excruciating pain awaited Him. He fully knew that His hour had come!</P>

<P CLASS="CENTER"><BIG><B><FONT COLOR="#FF0000" SIZE="+3"><I>He was Jesus, the Christ!</I></FONT></B></BIG></P>

<P>While the whole city was celebrating the Passover with every ritual gaiety, He should have to pass from this world to His Heavenly Father through the exasperating agony that would have to pierce into pieces His Soul and Body alike at the torturous cross of Golgotha under the midday scorching sun!</P>

<P>Jesus had no other go ... !</P>

<P>These were all carefully pre-planned by His beloved father with faultless accuracy in every aspect.</P>

<P>By His father ... ?</P>

<P>Yes ... !</P>

<P>Reason ... ?</P>

<P>His love for this world; His love for this mankind; His love to redeem us from eternal punishment and His love to give us everlasting life ... !</P>

<CENTER><TABLE WIDTH="50%><tr"><TD><P CLASS="noindent"><FONT COLOR="#0000FF"><I><B>"For God so loved the world, that He gave His only begotten Son, that whosoever believeth in Him should not perish, but have everlasting life."</I>(John 3:16)</B></FONT></P></TD></TR></TABLE> </CENTER>

<P>Because of this uncompromising love toward us, our God Eternal prepared to send His only Son, Jesus as a ransom for us all.</P>

<P>In earlier days God Himself appointed various sacrifices to absolve mankind from their sins. Refer to the Book of Leviticus in the Bible.</P>

<P><FONT COLOR="##0000FF"><B><I>'The <BIG>L<SMALL>ord</SMALL></BIG> hath sworn, and will not repent'</I></B></FONT> at any cost. [Ps.110:4]</P>

<P>So, when the time for His redemption had come, He decided to send forth His Son to this world <B><I>'through the seed of David'</I></B> for the purpose [Jn.7:42].</P>

<P>Jesus also obliged His Father...!</P>

<P>Jesus came to this world with full authority to lay down His life and to have the power to take it again.</P>

<P>Though He received this authority from His Father, Jesus had the full option to execute those powers according to His own free will. But He never allowed His will to interfere with His Father's will. He was always so honest and keen to fulfil His Father's will alone. That is why, His Father also loved Him. [Jn. 10:17&18].</P>

<P>During His childhood, He said,"<FONT COLOR="#0000FF"><B><I>... I must be about my Father's business..</I></B></FONT>" [Lk. 2:49].</P>

<P>In His final hours, He said,"<FONT COLOR="#0000FF"><B><I>... the world may know that I love the Father; and as the Father gave me commandment, even so I do..</I></B></FONT>" [Jn. 14:31]</P>

<P>So, from cradle to Calvary, Jesus soaked Himself perfectly into His Father's will!</P>

<P>He never bothered about anything else!</P>

<P>Now the time had come...!</P>

<P CLASS="noindent"><B><FONT SIZE="7" COLOR="#FF0000">J</FONT>ESUS ROSE IN</B> the middle of the supper which He wanted to have with all His dear ones. Moreover, this particular supper had typified significantly His whole life and mission in a nutshell.</P>

<P>The <B>L<SMALL>ORD</SMALL></B> of lords washed His disciples feet, as an obedient slave to His master!</P>

<P>The Creator bade farewell to His traitor as if not interfering into another man's business, whatever may be its outcome!</P>

<P>Then began His marathon discourse!</P>

<P>This 125-verse-instruction and prayer starts with a commandment...</P>

<P CLASS="CENTER"><FONT COLOR="#0000FF"><B><I>NEW COMMANDMENT...!</I> [Jn. 13:34]</B></FONT></P>

<P>In the course of His speech He again emphasised this in Jn. 15:12 as <FONT COLOR="#0000FF"><B><I>'MY COMMANDMENT...!'</I></B></FONT></P>

<P>What is it?</P>

<P><FONT COLOR="#0000FF"><B><I>'That ye love one another as I have loved you'.</I></B></FONT></P>

<P>Simple ... Very simple ... to hear and read...! Wow!</P>

<P>But...!</P>

<P>In practice, it has been a ...<IMG SRC="image%20source/A_1.gif"></P>

<P>Is it possible? ... Is this the real thing that He wants us to follow?</P>

<P>Yes... unless and until we observe this commandment, we could never be known to others as <FONT COLOR="#FF0000" SIZE="+2"><B><I>'HIS DISCIPLES!'</I> [Jn. 13:35].</B></FONT></P>

<P>Not only that, Jn. 15:13&14 says, that through this alone we can also become <FONT COLOR="#FF0000" SIZE="+2"><B><I>'HIS FRIENDS!'</I></B></FONT></P>

<P>Hallelujah!</P>

<P>What a simple way to become the <B>L<SMALL>ORD</SMALL></B>'s disciple and friend!</P>

<P>Jesus repeatedly insists us to keep this particular commandment as He has kept His Father's. [Jn. 15:10].</P>

<P>On that eventful Thursday evening, He was so much particular to emphasise this commandment again and again in every way.</P>

<P>Read Jn. 15:13. There He tells us how that love would be or what kind of love He expects from us.</P>

<CENTER><TABLE WIDTH="50%><tr"><TD><P CLASS="noindent"><FONT COLOR="#0000FF"><I><B>"Greater love hath no man than this that a man lay down his life for his friends."</I></B></FONT></P></TD></TR></TABLE> </CENTER>

<P>In the very next verse He says: <FONT COLOR="#0000FF"><I><B>"Ye are my friends if ye do whatever I command you."</I></B></FONT></P>

<P>So, He is very clear in His teaching. He wants us to love one another to the extent of laying down our life for one another.</P>

<P>What a deep love He expects from us...!</P>

<P>If we show and practice such a deep love to one another,<U><B>only then</B></U> we are eligible to be called as His disciples and His friends!</P>

<P>Already He had walked on this earth as a living example of this deep love: He gave His life for us while we were yet sinners and enemies. Through His death, we were reconciled to God beside saved by His life. [Rom. 5:10].</P>

<P>So, it is our turn now, to show such deep love to our enemies and friends alike!</P>

<A HREF="#top"><IMG SRC="image%20source/top1.png" ALIGN="right" BORDER="0" WIDTH="50"></A>

<P CLASS="noindent"><B><FONT SIZE="7" COLOR="#FF0000">H</FONT>OWEVER, THIS IS</B> totally impossible for us. Strictly speaking, we feel a vacuum in this area. For this, we still need some help from within and without.</P>

<P>Knowing our plight, our <B>L<SMALL>ORD</SMALL></B> and Saviour graciously promises to send another Comforter, The Spirit of Truth who would guide us into all truth [Jn. 16:13]. With the guidance and help of the Holy Ghost, we do mortify the deeds of the body and can abide in Jesus Christ!</P>

<P>To receive this Holy Ghost, which is the promise of the Father, we have to wait with one accord in one place. that is the only norm laid down for this purpose. [Act 1:4&2:1].</P>

<P>In Joel 2:28, it is written, <FONT COLOR="#0000FF"><I><B>"... I will pour out my Spirit upon all flesh"</I></B></FONT>.</P>

<P>In Jn. 16:23&24, Jesus says: <FONT COLOR="#0000FF"><I><B>"... verily, verily, I say unto you, whatsoever ye shall ask the Father in My name, He will give it to you. Hitherto have ye asked nothing in My name: ask and you shall receive, that your joy may be full"</I></B></FONT>.</P>

<P>So let us ask accordingly, and receive the Holy Spirit to the fullness of our joy. Then we can love Jesus with all our heart, soul and mind without any inhibition or impedance. Only by this love we can realise deep in our heart that He died for us: And with this help of the Holy Ghost, we shall <FONT COLOR="#0000FF"><I><B>"not henceforth live unto ourselves, but unto Him which died for us and rose again."</I></B></FONT> [2Cor. 5:15]. Also, we can say triumphantly with Paul: <FONT COLOR="#0000FF"><I><B>"I am crucified with Christ: nevertheless, I live; yet not I, but Christ liveth in me: and the life which I now live in the flesh I live by the faith of the Son of God, who loved me and gave Himself for me."</I></B></FONT> [Gal. 2:20].</P>

<P>At this stage, it is much easier for us to endearth even our enemies. this is what our Saviour expects from us. Also, through this love, we begin to keep up His word: the commandment of Christ. This shows that we are loving Jesus dearly. Hence, God the Father will also love us and along with Jesus, He will come unto us, and make His abode with us. This is what Jn. 14:23 says!</P>

<P>Hallelujah!</P>

<P><FONT COLOR="#0000FF">'Go ye into all the world, and preach the Gospel to every creature'.</FONT></I></B></P>

<P>Without love how can we go into the world? That is why, Jesus wants to cultivate such a deep love among His disciples on the pattern of His love toward His Heavenly Father!</P>

<P>By cultivating such an uncompromising love, our <B>L<SMALL>ORD</SMALL></B> wants to imprint in us, His longing ... unquenchable longing for the lost sheep!</P>

<P>Even in the Christian circle, some of its leaders may also hail this as a perfect religious tolerance, because they want to accommodate other religious people without hurting them at any point and without disturbing their religious faith at any count under one roof in the name of charity.

<P>Paul, the Apostle had this longing in him.

<P>Why such pain...? Why such agony...? Why to the extent of travail in birth...?</P>

How seriously people take this notice becomes evident when you take a short walk and see the nearby houses. Most of them - even the spanking new ones - have been built from the centuries-old bricks taken from this monument.</P>

<P>Otherwise it can be said that the Body of Christ has been ruined by our doctrines and divisions: And in due course, we made this church, the Body of Christ, a monument in every aspect.</P>

<P> Of course, this may be because of His doing at that memorable Last Supper in the Upper Room; while He asked His disciples to take and divide among themselves the <B><I>'blood if the New Testament'</I></B>, he took bread, gave thanks to His Father, <FONT COLOR="red" SIZE="+2"><B>BROKE IT,</B></FONT> and gave to them, saying: <FONT COLOR="red"><B><I>'This is my body which is given for you: this do in remembrance of me'.</I></B></FONT></P>

It is not that the truth sought for is not in the Word, but that through lack of communion with Him, who gave the Word, we have not enough of His mind to apprehend His meaning, even where He has fully expressed it."</B></I></P>

<P>When we apply our mind to know the Word, the problems come in...! We understand it in every way about our mood and movement. We find new interpretations at every situation and time according to our fanciful thinking. then it gives birth to a new doctrine which is to be followed very promptly by a new denomination.</P>

<P>Now we are in every way ready to pull down some bricks from the massive structure of the Body of Christ. We also use some bricks which have already fallen and feel some uneasiness in their new-found environs.

Then He gave it to us as His only begotten Son; At last, He gave His Spirit to whoever asked for it to understand His Word in its rightful perception and to follow His Son in every walk of life until we reach His Heavenly abode.</P>

<P>The God Almighty never gave us individually anything like creeds or doctrines. His only aim regarding us is that we should learn to know and follow the ever-living Christ! But, this is the conspicuous missing in our midst today.</P>

<P>Hence, His ultimate goal of <FONT COLOR="#FF0000" SIZE="+3"><B>'ONE-FOLD ... ONE SHEPHERD'</B></FONT> also cannot yet be accomplished with! And the Spirit of God also faces so many obstacles and denials in His mission!</P>

<P>Dr. Carl Henry, editor of 'Christian Today' was right when he said: "In twentieth-century Christianity, the Holy Spirit is still a displaced person. Liberal theology exiled this divine person from the life of the Church in favour of simply divine '<I>function</I>'."</P>

<P>Though our God Almighty graciously gave promise in Joel 2:28 for the downpouring of His Spirit upon all flesh in our days, we are never ready to ask for Him or accept Him or adore Him. We are deliriously afraid of Him and disallow Him into our midst. Whenever the Christians made the Spirit of God a refuge, they became the real vagabonds. They can never understand the love of Christ and so they could not love one another. Also, they have to go pillar to post for peace and for true light to know the true way!</P>

<P CLASS="noindent"><B><FONT SIZE="7" COLOR="#FF0000">T</FONT>HE TIME IS</B> running out! At any moment our <B>L<SMALL>ORD</SMALL></B> will come. Already He is at the door! The events of the world tell us that there is no more time left. <I>At spes non fracta!</I> So, even in this last minute itself, let us realize our blunder!</P>

<P>Let us accept our unworthiness and lack of understanding in knowing His Words with an open heart!</P>

<P>Remove all reservations from our mind!</P>

<P>Let our ego and our complexes be jettisoned forthwith!</P>

<P>Don't vainly argue on the strength of 1Cor.11:19 that heresies are good. Gal.5:20 clearly says that heresies <FONT COLOR="#0000FF" WEIGHT="bold"><I>'are the works of the flesh'</I></FONT>. Only to manifest <FONT COLOR="#0000FF" WEIGHT="bold"><I>'which are approved', 'the works of the flesh'</I></FONT> are necessary. So, why should we trail behind <FONT COLOR="#0000FF" WEIGHT="bold"><I>'the flesh'</I></FONT>? Let us crucify <FONT COLOR="#0000FF" WEIGHT="bold"><I>'our flesh'</I></FONT>, which always <FONT COLOR="#0000FF" WEIGHT="bold"><I>'lusteth against the Spirit'</I></FONT>.</P>

<P>Let us live in the Spirit and walk in the Spirit.</P>

<P>Have it in your mind... the whole life of our <B>L<SMALL>ORD</SMALL></B> is the Gospel to mankind!</P>

<P>The apostles followed His footsteps and spread that Gospel everywhere!</P>

<P>The first-century missionary, Paul declares when he writes to the Corinthians: <FONT COLOR="#0000FF" WEIGHT="bold"><I>'Now thanks be unto God which always causeth us to triumph in Christ and maketh manifest the savour of His knowledge by us in every place; For we are unto God a sweet savour of Christ...'</I></FONT> [2Cor.2:14&15].</P>

<P>The Apostles had His experience and had no doctrine. So that, they could be <FONT COLOR="#0000FF" WEIGHT="bold"><I>'a sweet savour of Christ unto God'</I></FONT>. Only by this, they could establish <FONT COLOR="#FF0000" SIZE="+3"><B>'ONE-FOLD ... ONE SHEPHERD'</B></FONT> Church in those days.</P>

<P>Today every one of us has doctrines and have no experience unto His Glory.</P>

<P>Therefore, put aside our doctrines and denominations in a corner or if possible have enough courage and throw away those abominations from our midst!</P>

<P>Give way to the move of His Holy Ghost!</P>

<P CLASS="CENTER"><FONT COLOR="#006400" WEIGHT="bold" SIZE="+3"><I>Let our hearts aflame!</I></FONT></P>

<P>Come together as a Body of Christ with the help of the Holy Ghost!</P>

<P>Let us rejuvenate our spirit, body and soul into Jesus!</P>

<P>The Bible says in Is.40:31 - <FONT COLOR="#0000FF" WEIGHT="bold"><I>'... they that wait upon the <B>L<SMALL>ORD</SMALL></B> shall renew their strength; they shall mount up with wings as eagles; they shall run, and not be weary; and they shall walk, and not faint '</I></FONT>.</P>

<P>Come on ... <FONT COLOR="#006400" WEIGHT="bold" SIZE="+3"><I>let our hearts aflame!</I></FONT></P>

<P>Let all the denominational barriers be broken!</P>

<P>See, already <FONT COLOR="#0000FF" WEIGHT="bold"><I>'The Breaker is come up before'</I></FONT> us. [Mic.2:13].</P>

<P>Let every village, town and city have one Church each like in the Apostle era!</P>

<P>Let us move... move on...!</P>

<P>This is the time...!</P>

<P>The <B>L<SMALL>ORD</SMALL></B> is in our midst to pour out the latter rain!</P>

<P>Let all the unworthy doctrines be washed away in that downpouring!</P>

<P>Hallelujah!</P>

<P>Come on... wherever you are, leave these viewing for a while and kneel down before His presence...! He is there right now! The Spirit of the <B>L<SMALL>ORD</SMALL></B> is at your side...! Feel His presence... Feel His gentleness... Accept Him... Invite Him to reign over you! Surrender yourself at His bosom. He wants to use you as a mighty weapon in His hands to build His Church - <FONT COLOR="#FF0000" SIZE="+3"><B>'ONE-FOLD ... ONE SHEPHERD'</B></FONT>!</P>

<P>The love of God will freely flow through you to everyone you come across and you will become His disciple and friend.</P>

<P>A disciple and a friend to our <B>L<SMALL>ORD</SMALL></B>, the King of kings!</P>

<P><FONT COLOR="#006400" WEIGHT="bold" SIZE="+3"><I>Let our hearts aflame!</I></FONT></P>

<P>Quench not the Spirit!</P>

<P>Revival will surely have come in our generation!</P>

<P>Be a watchman for this <FONT COLOR="#FF0000" SIZE="+3"><B>'ONE-FOLD'</B></FONT> - the Body of Christ.</P>

<P>Because...</P>

<P>This is the real bride, the Lamb's wife. [Rev.21].</P>

<P><FONT COLOR="#0000FF" WEIGHT="bold"><I>'He which testifieth these things saith, surely I come quickly. Amen. Even so, come, <B>L<SMALL>ORD</SMALL></B> Jesus!'</P>

<P>He who hath ears to hear, let him hear!</P>

<P>The grace of our <B>L<SMALL>ORD</SMALL></B> Jesus Christ be with you all. Amen!</I></FONT></P>
