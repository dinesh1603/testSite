<P CLASS="noindent"><B><FONT SIZE="7" COLOR="#FF0000">H</FONT>E WAS BORN</B> on the way to Jerusalem, wrapped in swaddling cloths and laid in a manger.</P>

<P>- Brought up in a poor carpenter's family.</P>

<P>- Tempted by the devil and was with the wild animals while He was praying and fasting in the desert.</P>

<P>- He was in all points temted as we are; yet, without sin.</P>

<P>- Though He was targeted by the devil from His very birth, He went about doing good and healing all who were oppressed by the devil.</P>

<P>- Throughout His life in this world, His one and only concern was to glorify His Heavenly Father in each and every word and deed.</P>

<P>But . . .</P>

<P>- The teachers of the Law called Him, a 'blasphemist'.</P>

<P>- The Pharisees sneered at Him and branded Him 'the prince of demons' and 'the friend of sinners'.</P>

<P>- On hearing His speech, all the people in the Synagogue ferociously drove Him to the brow of the hill to throw Him down the cliff.</P>

<P>- His family members said that He was out of His mind.</P>

<P>- The Jews said that He was possessed by a demon and was raving mad.</P>

<P>- They also contemplated ranking Him a deceiver and sought all the more to kill Him.</P>

<P>- Many of His deciples turned away from Him; because they felt that His was a hard teaching.</P>

<P>- Two times He had to hide Himself from the Jews who tried to stone Him.</P>

<P>- With a single kiss, the one, who had been considered His friend and disciple betrayed Him.</P>

<P>- In the climacteric crucial emergency all His disciples deserted Him and fled.</P>

<P>- The chief of His disciples not only disowned Him but also cursed Him and swore against Him three times within a night.</P>

<P>- His captors spat on His face, struck Him with their fists and slapped Him mercilessly.</P>

<P>- They also said many insulting abuses against Him.</P>

<P>- The Governor of the land ridiculed Him and jeered at Him along with his soldiers.</P>

<P>- He was beastly flogged by the Roman soldiers for thirty-nine times without a single break.</P>

<P>- The whole company of the Governor's soldiers came together and stripped Him totally; put a scarlet robe on Him (<I>in view to mask the profusing blood exudation that would have splattered all over His body after the gruesome barbarian torture</I>); set on His head a crown of thorns; spat on Him; struck His head, that was already embedded with spiky thorns, again and again with a staff and humiliated Him in all possible ways and means.</P>

<P>- Then He was brutally nailed to the cross without a single piece of cloth on His person, in between two well-known criminals of that time under the mid-day scorching sun.</P>

<P>- The people, the chief priests, the teachers of the Law and the elders made fun of Him.</P>

<P>- The criminals who were crucified by His sides also heaped insults on Him.</P>

<P>- Even while hanging in the cross after such an amplified excruciating torture, He committed no sin; nor was deceit found in His mouth: Instead, He pleaded for forgiveness to those tormentors.</P>

<P>- He accepted this path of life without any inhibitions and reservations; because, He knew well that, that was the only way to redeem us from the wretched clutches of the Evil.</P>

<P>- The Chastisement for our peace was upon Him.</P>

<P CLASS="noindent"><B><FONT SIZE="7" COLOR="#FF0000">A</FONT>FTER HE HAD</B> disarmed the dark forces in such an explicit manner on the cross, He gave a clarion call to all those who follow Him down through the ages: <I><B><BIG>GO INTO ALL THE WORLD</BIG></B></I> (i.e., every city and village) <I><B><BIG>AND PREACH THE GOSPEL</BIG></B></I> (the glad tidings of the Kingdom of God) <I><B><BIG>TO EVERY CREATURE'.</BIG></B></I>

<P>Truely a victorious call after He had triumphed over death through His resurrection in the third day as He had prophesized during His sojourn on the face of the earth as a human being.</P>

<P>Do you ever hear this exultant voice . . . ?</P>

<P>If you say that you are a Christian, then it is more than one hundred per cent surety that you have already heard this loving sweet voice!</P>

<P>Now the million doller question is:<BR><CENTER><FONT SIZE="5" FONT WEIGHT="bold" FONT COLOR="#0000ff">ARE YOU READY<BR>TO SUBMIT YOURSELF<BR>TO THIS<BR>MIGHTY CALL ?</FONT></CENTER></P>

<P CLASS="noindent"><B><FONT SIZE="7" COLOR="#FF0000">D</FONT>ON'T ROPE IN</B> charity and other multifacet social works in the place of preaching the Gospel and deceive yourself!</P>

<P>His call is for a war . . . !</P>

<P>- A war against the great deceiver to liberate and to gather His beloved subjects who are all redeemed through His Blood.</P>

<P>The day-to-day affairs affirm that the modern days' good works of charities and social works hardly bring glory to our Father in Heaven; but, to the doer himself!</P>

<P><BIG><BIG><B>Beware of it ... !</B></BIG></BIG></P>

<P>Also here comes the root of all evil . . . !</P>

<P>To do such work you need money. But, slowly after a short period, <I><B>'the need of money'</B></I> becomes <I><B>'the money for everything'</B></I> that leads to <I><B>'love for money'</B></I> which propels us into <I><B>'lust for money'</B></I> and finally makes the victim to land in <I><B>'unquenchable thirst for money!'</B></I> And you begin to stray away from the faith to which you are called; And you pierce yourself with many sorrows until the world swallow you up completely.</P>

<P>Moreover, those works will sure enough consume your valuable time and poisonously thwart your precious relationship with your Heavenly Father.</P>

<P>Also your work becomes <I><B>'a work in the name of Jesus'</B></I> instead <BIG><B>'the work to the glory of the God Almighty through our Saviour Jesus Christ'.</B></BIG> Your path of <B>'serving <U>to</U> the <BIG>LORD</BIG>'</B> deviates into the one of <I><B>'services <U>for</U> the <BIG>LORD</BIG>'.</B></I></P>

<P>Unlike Jesus, the doer of such charity or social work or any other related good work, easily falls prey to the evil design of the 'great deceiver' in a very grand manner.</P>

<P>Because, the name of our LORD will, by then automatically, be blasphemed among the gentiles due to your closeness with the world.</P>

<P>That is why in 1 John 2:15, it has been written -</p>

<p class="center"><FONT size="+2" COLOR="red"><I><B>'Do not love the world<BR>or,<BR>the things in the world.<BR><U>If anyone loves the world,<BR>the love of the Father is not in him.'</U></B></I></FONT></P>

<P>In James 4:4 also the Spirit of the LORD gives us a severe warning when He says - <EM><B><FONT COLOR="red">''... Do you not know that friendship with the world is enmity with God? Whoever therefore wants to be a friend of the world makes himself an enemy of God."</FONT></B></EM></P>

<P> Present-day charities and social works, one day or another, certainly transform you to be a friend of the world.</P>

<P>So, don't cheat yourself under the blanket of such charities and social works at least heretofore!</P>

<P>The Bible also clearly instructs us in 1 Thess. 5:22 - <EM><B><FONT COLOR="red">"Abstain from all appearance of evil."</FONT></B></EM></P>

<P CLASS="noindent"><B><FONT SIZE="7" COLOR="#FF0000">I</FONT>F YOU SAY</B> that this Jesus, who was crucified on the cross in the place of you, is your <B>LORD</B> and Saviour, then you have no other choice but tp obey His passionate call without fail.</P>

&nbsp;

<CENTER><B>OTHERWISE . . .</B></CENTER>

<P>That Jesus, whom you believe of yours, must have been a some other one, who has never had a place in the Bible at any cost . . . !</P>

<P>So, take this as the apt time for you to check it out and correct yourself.</P>

<P><EM><B><FONT COLOR="red">". . . the time has come for judgement to begin at the house of God"</FONT></B></EM> (1 Peter 4:17). So, let us cautiously <EM><B><FONT COLOR="red">"redeeming the time"</FONT></B></EM> (Ephesians 5:16).</P>
