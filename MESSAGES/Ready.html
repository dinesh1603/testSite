BUT, MANKIND IS LUDICROUSLY LURING ON WHAT IT HAS BEEN ALL THE WAY. ON THE LAST DAY OF EVERY YEAR, ALL THE NEWSPAPERS OF THE WORLD ASSESS THE EVENTS OF THE WHOLE YEAR AS VIOLENCE, BLEEDING, BRUISED, BATTERED, EXHILARATING OF TERRORISM, ETC.

<P CLASS="noindent"><B><FONT FACE="EngrvrsOldEng Bd BT" SIZE="36.0pt" COLOR="#CC00CC">T</FONT>HE INDIAN NEWS</B> tidings say that any hope of peace or prosperity in this land appears Utopian. What a pathetic avalanche that mutilates the very standard of human nature...!</P>

<P>Increasing failure in streamlining the law and order, put a big question mark on the effectiveness of most of the State Governments in India. The political leaders' appeal for a new social order habitually goes unheeded, at least two murders per day, a rape on every third day and kidnapping every alternate day miserably fail the Government machinery to move forward. The recent terrorist problem also threatens the very core of the smooth functioning of every government department. It left the common mass to resign to their so-called fate in the absence of any assistance from the powers that be.</P>

<P>In the educational sector vandalism rules the roost. Still, some States continue to linger at the lowest rung of academic development. To push up the bottom line of illiteracy, our governments have introduced many unusual schemes to educate people at the grassroots level. For example, the Government of Bihar went to the extent of opening '<B><I>Charwaha Vidhyalaya</I></B>' to educate the children of cattle grazers in their surroundings...!</P>

<P>Disruption in every development work coupled with the inadequate mobilisation of internal resources, however, belied all hopes of steering our land out of the cruel financial crisis. If we consider the number of currency notes alone is the criteria for the growth in economic front, then, ours is the number one in the world...!</P>

<P>The apathy of Government machinery made various military groups run parallel government mercilessly in some places. the police crackdown has neither whittled down the influence of these groups in their strongholds nor dented their determination to go ahead with their brutal activities by dispensing wild justice and passing even death sentences on those who are found guilty in their sights at the poverty-ridden and parched terrain.</P>

<P>In the mediatorially, cinema and lottery trades are gaining unprecedented momentum and the people go crazy after money and sex rather than anything else...!</P>

<P>Let us stop here and turn to the Scripture ... ... ...</P>

<P>Yes... the Spirit of God has prophesied the very essence of the race of man <I>en masse</I>. For all this madness, violence, terror and every shameful black mark on the history of civilisation, one simple word can well be substituted... that is ...<BR>&nbsp;<BR>

<P>You may deny it; but, the Word of God termed it clearly as - <FONT COLOR="#0000ff">SIN</FONT>...! The Bible tells us, <FONT COLOR="#0000ff"><I><B>"all have sinned and fall short of the glory of God'."</I></B></FONT> <SMALL>[Romans 3:23]</SMALL></P>

<P>So, to revive our position Jesus Christ came to the world and gave himself as a price for our sins in the Cross and redeemed us from the deathly pit of our transgressions. Now we enjoy His grace and inherit Sonship in Him through our faith in Him!</P>

<P>But what about our brothers and sisters who do not know or hear even once in their lifetime about this great Salvation?</P>

Yet 99 per cent of its population has been awaiting the Good News!</P>

<P>The media persons may blame the political arena for the baffling pathos of the people; the Machiavellians may censure the insalubrious trend of the mass media; and the people may equate their paralytic wretchedness to their un-propitiousness!</P>

<P>But... dear brothern in Christ, undisputedly it is you and me ... and we alone, who knows the Way, the Truth and the Life, are the real cause for this generate syndrome of North India, a part and parcel of our Nation!</P>

<P>Okay ... !</P>

<P>How then, can the people of North India call on the One whom they have not believed in? ... ... And how can they believe in the One of whom they have not heard? ... ... And how can they hear without someone preaching to them? ... ... And how can they preach unless they are not sent... ...?</P>

<P>If you say that you are the one, who has far too long been silently enjoying such a life-changing experience in Jesus Christ and keeping it within yourself, this is the apt time to let your light shine!</P>

<P>It is the time to let your fellow citizens know that Jesus is alive and will be at work in their lives also if they believe in Him and put their faith in Him.</P>

<P>Are you ready to be sent amidst this great multitude of spiritually valetudinarian people of North India <FONT COLOR="#0000ff"><B><I>'who cannot tell their right hand from their left.'</I></B></FONT></P>
