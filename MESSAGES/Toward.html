<P CLASS="noindent"><B><FONT SIZE="7" COLOR="#FF0000">T</FONT>HE WORLD EVENTS</B> unmistakably blow the trumpet with high degree fervidness announcing that our L<SMALL>ORD</SMALL> is on His way!</P>

<P>"The greatest peacetime event in the history of the world" - as was called by the ebullient extroverts - the centennial Olympic Games at the city of Atlanta was seen off with grandiose Hollywood razzmatazz that rekindled inevitably one's remembrance of Cecil B. DeMille's picturisation of Israelites worshipping the molten calf at the wilderness in voluptuous pomp and show due to the long absence of Moses in 'The Ten Commandments'.</P>

<P>This was the happening in August 1996!</P>

<P>On June 9, 1996, the world media flashed a news under the caption 'Britons stop believing in God'. It said that only 43 per cent of Britons believed in the Almighty compared with 76 per cent six years ago; although the rest felt (?) they were still religious!</P>

<P>On July 5, 1996, another piece of news came: Nearly 30,000 people, many dressed as nuns or policemen or in extravagant transvestite costumes, marched through Central London in 'the 25<SUP>th</SUP> lesbian, gay, bisexual and transgender pride march', that was organized by the homosexual rights activism to raise the profile of the gay community!</P>

<P>To cap it all came the radical proposal of the Church of England on July 18, 1996, to the effect that henceforth God, the Almighty would be considered as a non-sexiest Being to ensure the happiness of its women faithful in the new millennium, just four years away then.</P>

<P>It further advocated the tolerance of the gays and the reprieves to the priests who strayed from celibacy.</P>

<P>This General Synod which held its deliberations in York have also been daring and unconventional in its rethinking of the traditional view of 'Hell'. The reports from there said that the Biblical images of hell fire and damnation would be seen as nothingness!</P>

<P>These are the news from a country that carried the Gospel to almost the entire world during past centuries!</P>

<P>Don't be baffled! All these have to happen! Refer what the Bible says in 2Timothy 3:1-5.</P>

<P>However, the move of the Holy Spirit is also equally in high swing!</P>

<P><B>Let us, therefore, give ourselves in obedience and with the reverential fear to His eternal design of building the Body of Christ, the Church.</B></P>
